# Fruits - Banana

Bananas are a good source of vitamin C, potassium and dietary fibre.
Bananas have no fat, cholesterol or sodium.
Bananas are great for athletic and fitness activity because they replenish necessary carbohydrates, glycogen and body fluids burned during exercise.
Bananas are available all year-round. They are harvested every day of the year.
The banana industry in Australia is well over 100 years old.
A cluster of bananas is called a hand and consists of 10 to 20 bananas, which are known as fingers.
When you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice the other vitamins and minerals. 
Queensland grower Pacific Coast Eco-Bananas has registered the colour red - applied as a wax on up to a third of the fruit - as a trademark. The grower hopes to become the only grower allowed to use the colour to distinguish and promote its bananas in Australia. It is believed to be the first colour trademark registered for fresh fruit.
